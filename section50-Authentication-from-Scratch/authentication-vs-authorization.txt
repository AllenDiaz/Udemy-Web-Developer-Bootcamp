### **Cryptographic Hash Functions: Overview & Applications**

A **cryptographic hash function (CHF)** is a mathematical algorithm that transforms input data into a fixed-length hash value. It plays a crucial role in **data integrity, authentication, and security**.

### **Key Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions**

âœ… **Deterministic** â€“ The same input always produces the same hash.

âœ… **Fixed-Length Output** â€“ Regardless of input size, the hash has a consistent length.

âœ… **Collision Resistance** â€“ No two different inputs should produce the same hash.

âœ… **Pre-Image Resistance** â€“ It should be computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash.

âœ… **Avalanche Effect** â€“ A small change in input drastically alters the hash output.

### **Common Cryptographic Hash Algorithms**

ðŸ”¹ **MD5** â€“ Fast but vulnerable to collisions.

ðŸ”¹ **SHA-256** â€“ Secure and widely used in blockchain and authentication.

ðŸ”¹ **SHA-3** â€“ A newer standard with enhanced security.

ðŸ”¹ **BLAKE2** â€“ Optimized for speed and security.

### **Applications of Cryptographic Hash Functions**

ðŸ”¹ **Password Storage** â€“ Hashing passwords before storing them prevents direct exposure.

ðŸ”¹ **Digital Signatures** â€“ Ensures message authenticity and integrity.

ðŸ”¹ **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency** â€“ Used in Bitcoin and Ethereum for transaction verification.

ðŸ”¹ **Data Integrity Checks** â€“ Verifies that files or messages haven't been altered.

ðŸ”¹ **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)** â€“ Used for secure communication.
