IMPORTANT NOTE: Fixing npm install Issues In The Next Lecture
While following the upcoming lecture video, if you encounter any issues or errors when doing the npm install (or npm i) commands for installing the "multer-storage-cloudinary" and "cloudinary" packages, try to instead install these packages with their exact compatible versions specified below. You can do this by executing the following commands from the main project folder in the terminal:

npm install cloudinary@1.41.3

npm install multer-storage-cloudinary@4.0.0

npm install multer@1.4.5-lts.1

Then, it should work properly.

If you get any issues or questions, please reach out on the course Q&A boards.
